# I. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in education, particularly in fields like Software Engineering, where problem-solving, code optimization, and conceptual understanding are key learning components. In ICS 314, AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Co-Pilot have significantly enhanced my learning process. These tools are interactive resources that supplement traditional teaching methods, providing guidance, examples, and insights for various programming challenges. In this essay, I will reflect on my experiences with AI technologies throughout the course, analyzing their impact on my learning, understanding, and application of software engineering principles.

# II. Personal Experience with AI 
With my personal experience of AI, I’ve used it as a resource for troubleshooting errors and cleaning up my code in certain assignments. For example, during the beginning of ICS 314, we didn’t really use ESLint at the time so my code would usually be messy and have useless lines of code. My approach to fixing this problem was inputting all of my code into the AI chat and asking “Can you clean up my code and add comments to help with user clarity?” AI would easily fix that simple problem for me that would take some time for me in mere seconds. Another thing I would ask the AI is to help explain questions that are being explained. A problem I have a lot of time is comprehending what the question is asking me to do. To solve that problem, I would usually ask the AI “Can you rewrite/break down the question to help me understand it better?” Again, the AI would do its magic and easily solve my problem without any worry. 

## Experience WODs 
During the WODs, I primarily used ChatGPT to help me better understand how to approach the exercises. For example, when working on an E18-20 WODs related to functional programming, I prompted ChatGPT with, "Can you explain how functional programming works with TypeScript?" I asked that question because I still struggled to understand how and what each function does despite reading the documentation. After asking, ChatGPT provided an initial example that gave me a foundation to build upon, but the exact implementation required adjustments to align with the WOD requirements. While AI offered a good starting point, I had to use my reasoning to adapt the solution.
Benefit: AI helped clarify concepts and provided a reference implementation. Cost: The initial code was not always tailored to the specific WOD format, requiring additional effort to refine.

## In-class Practice WODs
For in-class practice WODs, I limited my use of AI because time constraints made it impractical to consult external tools. However, I did use AI afterward to reflect on my mistakes. For example, after completing a practice WOD on React components, I asked ChatGPT, "What are common mistakes when creating React functional components?" This helped me recognize where I went wrong and solidified my understanding.
Benefit: AI provided retrospective learning opportunities to improve my understanding. Cost: Using AI during the WOD would disrupt the learning experience.

## In-class WODs
I refrained from using AI during in-class WODs because I believed that relying on my own problem-solving skills under time constraints was essential for building confidence. However, I occasionally reviewed the WOD afterward with AI, asking questions like "How could this problem be solved more efficiently?" This enabled me to analyze alternative approaches.
Why not use AI during WODs: I felt that independent problem-solving was more beneficial for my learning during timed exercises.

## Essays
When writing essays for the course, I used AI tools like ChatGPT to help generate ideas and refine my writing. For instance, when working on an essay about software engineering ethics, I asked, "What are some key ethical concerns in software engineering?" ChatGPT provided a well-rounded list of topics, which I expanded upon using my own research and critical analysis.
Benefit: AI acted as a brainstorming tool that accelerated the initial planning process. Cost: Over-reliance on AI could stifle original thought if not carefully managed.

## Final Project
During the final project, my team used GitHub Co-Pilot to streamline parts of the coding process. For example, when creating API endpoints, we used Co-Pilot to generate boilerplate Express.js code. I also used ChatGPT to debug errors, asking questions like, "Why does this React component throw an undefined error when accessing props?" While AI was incredibly helpful, we had to critically evaluate the generated code to ensure it met our project requirements.
Benefit: AI tools improved productivity and debugging efficiency.
Cost: Blindly accepting AI-generated code could introduce subtle errors.

## Learning a Concept / Tutorial
When learning a new concept, such as closures in JavaScript, I often asked ChatGPT for explanations like, "Explain closures in JavaScript with examples." The responses were clear and beginner-friendly, and I appreciated the variety of examples provided.
Benefit: AI provided accessible explanations for difficult concepts. 
Cost: AI explanations sometimes lacked depth or failed to cover edge cases.

## Answering a Question in Class or on Discord
I occasionally used AI to verify my understanding before answering a question. For instance, on Discord, I double-checked with ChatGPT: "What does the setState function in React do exactly?" before posting my response. This helped ensure I gave accurate answers.
Benefit: AI increased my confidence when answering questions.

## Asking or Answering a Smart-Question
To formulate a smart question, I sometimes refined my thoughts using AI. For example, I asked ChatGPT, "How can I clarify a question about React state management to get the best answer from peers?" AI provided suggestions that helped me frame my questions more effectively.

## Coding Example (e.g., Using Underscore.js)
For coding examples, I used ChatGPT to generate sample code. For instance, I asked, "Give an example of using underscore.js to pluck values from an array of objects." AI provided a concise example that demonstrated the use of .pluck effectively.

## Explaining Code
When preparing to explain code to classmates, I asked AI to help simplify my explanations. For instance, "How can I explain the concept of asynchronous programming to a beginner?" AI offered clear analogies that I used to explain the topic.

## Writing Code
AI tools like GitHub Co-Pilot were useful for generating repetitive code structures, such as API routes or utility functions. However, I made sure to review and refine the code to align with project needs.

## Documenting Code
I used AI to generate comments and documentation. For example, "Write JSDoc comments for this function." While AI saved time, I reviewed the documentation for clarity and accuracy.

## Quality Assurance
For debugging, I used ChatGPT to ask, "What’s wrong with this code snippet?" AI often identified syntax errors and suggested fixes, speeding up the debugging process.

# III. Impact on Learning and Understanding
Incorporating AI tools significantly enhanced my learning experience in ICS 314. AI improved my comprehension by providing clear explanations and examples for complex concepts. It accelerated skill development by helping me debug code and streamline repetitive tasks. However, I also learned to balance AI assistance with independent problem-solving to strengthen my critical thinking abilities.

# IV. Practical Applications
Outside of ICS 314, I used AI tools during collaborative projects, such as our Final Project. For example, during the final weeks of the course, my team utilized GitHub Co-Pilot to generate code quickly, allowing us to focus on high-level design decisions. This demonstrated the practical utility of AI in addressing real-world software engineering challenges.

# V. Challenges and Opportunities
One challenge I faced with AI tools was the occasional inaccuracy or over-simplification of answers. Additionally, there is a risk of over-reliance, which can hinder the development of independent problem-solving skills. However, the opportunity for further integration of AI in software engineering education is immense, particularly in areas like personalized learning and code review automation.

# VI. Comparative Analysis
Compared to traditional teaching methods, AI-enhanced approaches offer increased flexibility, immediate feedback, and personalized assistance. While traditional methods foster critical thinking and self-reliance, AI tools can accelerate the learning process by filling knowledge gaps and automating repetitive tasks.

# VII. Future Considerations
Looking ahead, AI will likely play a greater role in software engineering education, with advancements in personalized learning tools, real-time code analysis, and collaborative development platforms. However, it will be important to emphasize a balance between AI assistance and independent problem-solving to ensure students develop essential skills.

# VIII. Conclusion
Reflecting on my experiences with AI in ICS 314, I have found these tools to be valuable supplements to traditional learning methods. While AI has enhanced my understanding and productivity, I have also learned the importance of critical thinking and independent effort. For future courses, I recommend integrating AI tools more strategically, with clear guidance on how to use them effectively without compromising learning outcomes.
