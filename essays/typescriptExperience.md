## The Introduction to TypeScript

When first learning about a new programming language, I always get worried, thinking that I’ll have to work overtime to get used to understanding the syntax and the overall language. However, in this case, I was deemed lucky due to having a moderate amount of experience with JavaScript dating back to high school. In addition, if you didn’t know, TypeScript is practically the child of JavaScript. It’s built on top of JavaScript, meaning all of my existing knowledge is carried over, making the transition smoother than expected. Knowing me though, I still made it hard practicing with TypeScript because some JavaScript syntax is essentially burned into my head to the point where I just type it on reflex even though I am supposed to be using TypeScript syntax. What made it more difficult was that in my ICS 314(Software Engineering)course, we essentially had a week to understand the fundamentals of TypeScript before having to take a quiz, or rather a WOD, to test our skills. This tight deadline made it hard to ease into the language, but it also made me laser-focused on the most important concepts. 

## The WODs

WOD also known as “workout of the day” are little coding challenges that are timed, that we do to help us gain some experience coding while on the clock. It’s a fun little twist on practicing and I for one, enjoy it. I say it’s fun but there's always two sides to a coin. The problem with WODs is that you either get 100% credit or no credit at all. Knowing that makes WODs a little daunting and puts more pressure than there needs to be. Even if I became accustomed to the time limit, it was more nerve-racking about the fact that I wasn’t fully comfortable with the material I just learned about. However, this pressure in learning TypeScript opened a door known as “athletic software engineering.” As the name implies, I am software engineering… athletically? Anyways, the WODs being somewhat stressful made me have to put the work and effort in to get the credit and keep up with the class. I truly believe that WODs are a great addition when learning a new programming language. It encourages growth which is crucial to learn. Plus, it gave me a sense of accomplishment when I managed to complete my first one within the time limit.


## My Overall Experience

Overall, I believe my experience with learning TypeScript has been a mix of both challenges and growth. Initially, I felt the pressure to quickly adapt to the little changes in the syntax and the timed nature of the WODs added another layer of stress. However, I can’t deny that the process forced me to improve my coding speed and problem-solving skills. I found myself learning not just TypeScript, but also how to manage time better under pressure. The structured nature of TypeScript, especially the emphasis on types, felt restrictive at first compared to JavaScript’s flexibility. But over time, I started to appreciate how it reduces the chance of errors and makes debugging easier. In the end, while it wasn’t a smooth start, I came out and continued to feel more confident in my ability to handle both JavaScript and TypeScript. Although it hasn’t been a while since learning TypeScript, I can genuinely say that the challenges were worth it, as I’ve gained a stronger foundation in both languages and learned how to think more critically as a developer.
