# SpotMeBro
### Authors: Ashton Aparra, Coen Bracilano, and Adeil Mohammadzadah
## Overview
The Problem: Many students struggle to stay motivated when working out alone and could benefit from a gym partner supporting and challenging them. While fitness apps focus on tracking progress and providing workout routines, they often lack a social component that can make the gym experience more engaging and enjoyable. As a result, students miss out on the benefits of having a gym buddy, such as accountability, motivation, and companionship.

The Solution: SpotMeBro is a platform designed to connect students with gym partners based on their fitness level, experience, and goals. Whether you're a beginner looking for guidance or an advanced gym-goer seeking a partner to push your limits, spot-me-bro aims to enhance your workout experience. The app fosters community by matching users with compatible fitness partners, helping them achieve their goals together.
