# SpotMeBro
### Authors: Ashton Aparra, Coen Bracilano, and Adeil Mohammadzadah
## Overview
**The Problem:** Many students struggle to stay motivated when working out alone and could benefit from a gym partner supporting and challenging them. While fitness apps focus on tracking progress and providing workout routines, they often lack a social component that can make the gym experience more engaging and enjoyable. As a result, students miss out on the benefits of having a gym buddy, such as accountability, motivation, and companionship.

**The Solution:** SpotMeBro is a platform designed to connect students with gym partners based on their fitness level, experience, and goals. Whether you're a beginner looking for guidance or an advanced gym-goer seeking a partner to push your limits, SpotMeBro aims to enhance your workout experience. The app fosters community by matching users with compatible fitness partners, helping them achieve their goals together.

## Technology Stack 
**Node.js:** Used for the JavaScript-based implementation of both client and server-side code, enabling efficient handling of user requests and data processing.

**React:** Implements a component-based UI, allowing for a dynamic and responsive user interface with seamless navigation between different pages.

**React Bootstrap:** Provides a modern and cohesive design using pre-built UI components, ensuring a polished and user-friendly experience.

**Uniforms:** Utilized for form creation and management, using React and Semantic UI to build intuitive forms for user profiles and preferences.

**PostgreSQL:** Manages the SQL database for securely storing user profiles, workout preferences, and match history.

## User Guide 
Once registered, users can create a profile that showcases their strengths across five categories: Push, Pull, Legs, Full Body, and Cardio. When logging into the app, users will be prompted to select their workout focus for the day. SpotMeBro will then match them with other users who have similar abilities and goals for a given workout session. The matched users receive each other's contact information, making it easy to connect and plan a workout together.

## Mockup Page Ideas 
**Home Page:** Features a welcoming layout with a call-to-action for users to “Find a Gym Partner” or “Browse Workout Plans.” It also highlights success stories from users who found motivation and new friends through the app.

**User Profile:** Users can customize their profile with details like fitness goals, availability, and preferred workout categories. This page displays users' match history, upcoming gym sessions, and progress in different workout categories.

**Partner Finder:** A dedicated page for users to explore potential gym partners. The platform filters users based on selected criteria, such as fitness level and workout preference, making it easy to find the perfect match.

**Support & Resources:** A page with links to fitness articles, nutritional advice, and local gym directories to support users in achieving their fitness goals.
