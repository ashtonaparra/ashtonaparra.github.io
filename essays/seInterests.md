*It's not about the destination, it's about the journey.*

As a kid, I was always fascinated by the world of technology and how things worked behind the scenes. My curiosity naturally led me to explore software engineering, where I quickly became captivated by the idea of creating something from nothing with just a few lines of code. I would spend hours watching videos online, learning how to code and experimenting with small projects. Those early experiences, sitting in front of my computer and soaking in as much knowledge as I could, fueled my passion and made me realize that I wanted to pursue a career in software engineering.

## The High School Days

In my junior year of high school, I decided to take a computer programming class, which opened the door to an exciting world of coding. I enjoyed it so much that. Around this time, COVID-19 hit, and we transitioned to remote learning, which presented its challenges. However, the extra time at home allowed me to dive deeper into programming languages like Java, HTML, and JavaScript. Even though the circumstances were tough, it was a pivotal moment in strengthening my coding skills and sparking a deeper interest in software development. By senior year, I enrolled in AP Computer Science and it was a challenge being pushed to a whole new level. 

## Where I'm Headed

As a junior in college, my passion for software engineering continues to grow, but the journey hasnâ€™t been without its challenges. Adapting to college life and managing the workload has been difficult at times, especially with the demanding nature of my courses. Balancing projects, assignments, and exams has taught me the importance of time management and perseverance. Despite the struggles, I remain committed to honing my coding skills and gaining hands-on experience in areas like back-end architecture and front-end design. I hope to further develop my problem-solving abilities and collaborate on projects that push me to create efficient, user-friendly applications, all while navigating the demands of college life.
